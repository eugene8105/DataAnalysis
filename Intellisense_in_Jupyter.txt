Enable Intellisense in Jupyter notebooks:

Just add line below at the top of your notebook:

%config IPCompleter.greedy=True

Now you get pretty pretty intellisense soon as you hit TAB.


Now there's a better way to get accurate code completion operation. It can be triggered by any character you typed. Inspired by TabNine, I developed a code auto-completion extension for Jupyter Notebook Jupyter TabNine.

It's available on pypi index now. Simply issue following commands, then enjoy it:)

pip3 install jupyter-tabnine
jupyter nbextension install --py jupyter_tabnine
jupyter nbextension enable --py jupyter_tabnine
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyter_tabnine
